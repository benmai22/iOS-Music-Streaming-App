# iOS-Music-Streaming-App
An iOS Music Streaming App that was coded with Swift. The app retrieves the albums and songs stored in the Cloud Firestore database, and it allows users to choose among the ones that show up. A user can play, pause, go back to the previous song, and go to the next song. Album images also show up just as well, which were stored with Firebase Storage. Users have the option to horizontally scroll between albums of their choice, and the songs are listed in a vertical manner. All the information load from the Firestore database: Album Image, Album Title, Song Title, and Song Mp3 Files.
